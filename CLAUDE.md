# CLAUDE.md — `claude-prompts-analysis`

## What this repo is

Quantitative linguistic analysis of the **287-file `claude-code-system-prompts`** corpus (Piebald-AI's reverse-engineered collection of Claude Code's shipping prompts). Eight cells of spaCy + custom analyzers profile every prompt along nine dimensions (mood / register / stance / sentence_register / modality / vocab / ALL CAPS / CAPS imperative / justification), aggregate per-file + per-category + corpus-wide, and emit a single ~1 MiB YAML data file. Six consumer notebooks render Altair dashboards on top.

This analysis is the empirical foundation for a **Claude Explorer AI Welfare submission** titled **"Claude Code should encourage reasoning over blind obedience"**, intended for the Claudexplorers community feedback initiative collecting proposals for Kyle Fish (Anthropic's Model Welfare Lead). See [§ 8](#8-the-claude-explorer-submission) below for the framing.

---

## 1. Quick start

```bash
# Clone the repo, then populate the corpus submodule
git submodule update --init

# (Optional) install the spaCy English model — already present in the JupyterLab kernel,
# but listed here for environments that don't have it
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Required Python deps (already in the project's JupyterLab kernel):

`spacy>=3.8` · `en_core_web_sm` 3.8.0 · `pandas` · `pyyaml` · `pyarrow` · `altair>=6` · `vl-convert-python` · `vega_datasets` · `python-frontmatter` · `tqdm`

(`pyarrow` is for the `sentences_classified.parquet` artifact emitted by `00_data_pipeline.ipynb` alongside the YAML. `vl-convert-python` is the Altair PNG export backend used by `08_summary.ipynb` to write the headline charts under `figures/`.)

**Run order** (always producer first):

1. Open `00_data_pipeline.ipynb` in JupyterLab → Run All. Produces `prompt_linguistic_analysis.yaml` (~1.7 MiB, 287 files × per-file metric tree + lexicons + corpus + per-category) AND `sentences_classified.parquet` (~5,694 rows, per-sentence forensic-inspection table).
2. Open any consumer notebook (`01_*` … `08_*`). Each loads the YAML (and optionally the parquet, in `07_rule_explanation.ipynb` and `08_summary.ipynb`) and renders charts. Consumers do **not** re-run spaCy — they're pure data viewers. Start with `08_summary.ipynb` for the executive-summary view; the other consumers each focus on one slice of the analysis.

Tier-3 v1: judgment-vs-procedural ratio, threat-vs-causal split, address-form mix, cumulative judgment-to-procedural trend. Tier-3 v2: imperative-streak counts + top-15 streak ranking, in-vs-outside RULES-section explanation gap. Refinement-round additions: positive-exemplar ranking, self-bias correlation check, parquet-based forensic-evidence sample |
| `08_summary.ipynb` | Cross-cutting synthesis: headline-data block (12 corpus-level numbers), the single most-important chart (cumulative `judgment_to_procedural_ratio`), welfare-evidence + positive-exemplar paired top-10, final conclusions, recommendations to Anthropic, limitations. Standalone-runnable; the executive-summary entry point for PROPOSAL.md drafting |

## 3. Shared module — `prompt_analysis.py`

Lives at the project root, imported by every consumer's setup cell. Public API:

> **For laypersons / welfare-submission readers**: every linguistic and statistical term used in any notebook is defined in [`GLOSSARY.md`](./GLOSSARY.md) at the repo root. If a chart axis label, tooltip field, or markdown phrase looks unfamiliar, that's the canonical reference.

```python
# Constants
TABLEAU10: list[str]
SR_CLASS_COLORS: dict[str, str] # 6-tone palette for sentence_register classes
SENT_REGISTER_CLASSES: list[str] # ["collaborative", "permissive", "appreciative",
 # "imperative", "directive", "configuring"]

# Functions
load_yaml(path="prompt_linguistic_analysis.yaml") -> dict
build_alt_df(data) -> pd.DataFrame # ~150-column flat per-file df (Tier-1 + Tier-3 + splits)
version_order(alt_df) -> list[str] # sorted ccVersions oldest→newest
category_colors(cats) -> dict[str, str]
directiveness(alt_df) -> pd.Series # extended composite z-score
cumulative_by_version(alt_df, metrics, agg="mean") # running aggregate over files in versions ≤ V
welfare_evidence_table(alt_df, top_n=25) # top-N "loudest, least-explained" files
positive_exemplar_table(alt_df, top_n=25, min_n_sents=10, min_rule_n=5) # top-N "rules-with-reasons" exemplars (inverse welfare-evidence)
```

**Per-sentence forensic-inspection artifact**: `sentences_classified.parquet` is emitted alongside the YAML. Load with `pd.read_parquet("sentences_classified.parquet")` for individual-sentence inspection (raw text + classifier flags). Schema documented in the producer cell that writes it. ~5,694 rows × 18 columns. Used by `07_rule_explanation.ipynb` for forensic evidence; other consumers stay YAML-only.

**Opinion cells convention**: notebooks 00–07 contain markdown cells visually marked `### My perspective (Claude) — opinion, not data` or `### My wish for future versions of this analysis — methodology, not data` (with horizontal-rule frames + blockquoted bodies). These are interpretation, not measurement, and can be skipped for a pure-data read.

The Tier-3 (welfare-extension) columns added by `build_alt_df`:

- `rule_n`, `rule_density`, `rule_explained_same_pct`, `rule_explained_para_pct`, `imp_explained_para_pct`, `prohib_explained_para_pct` — rule-pairing metrics from the producer's `metrics.rule_explanation` block.
- `judgment_count`, `procedural_count`, `judgment_to_procedural_ratio` — Tier-3 6a (welfare-thesis metric).
- `threat_count`, `causal_count`, `threat_share` — Tier-3 6d (consequence-framing split).
- `question_count`, `apology_count` — Tier-3 6f (near-zero pragmatic classes).
- `selfref_claude`, `selfref_assistant`, `selfref_model`, `pct_anthropomorphic`, `pct_artifact`, `pct_role` — Tier-3 6g (address-form analysis).
- `prohibition_to_prescription_ratio` — Tier-3 6c (pure derivation in `build_alt_df`, no producer field).
- `streak_max`, `streak_mean`, `streak_n_ge3`, `streak_n_ge5`, `streak_n_streaks` — Tier-3 v2 6b (imperative-streak distribution).
- `rs_pct_rule_paragraphs_explained_in`, `rs_pct_rule_paragraphs_explained_out`, `rs_n_rule_paragraphs_in`, `rs_n_rule_paragraphs_out`, plus `_explained` count variants — Tier-3 v2 6e (in vs outside RULES-section gap).

Standard consumer setup cell (~10 lines):

```python
import importlib, altair as alt, pandas as pd
import prompt_analysis; importlib.reload(prompt_analysis)
from prompt_analysis import (load_yaml, build_alt_df, version_order, category_colors,
 directiveness, SR_CLASS_COLORS, SENT_REGISTER_CLASSES)
alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows
data = load_yaml
alt_df = build_alt_df(data)
alt_df["directiveness"] = directiveness(alt_df)
by_category, corpus_block, per_file_records = data["by_category"], data["corpus"], data["files"]
cats = list(by_category.keys); CATEGORY_COLORS = category_colors(cats)
```

The `importlib.reload` line is intentional — it picks up edits to `prompt_analysis.py` without requiring a kernel restart.

---

## 4. ⚠️ TOOLING RULES — IMPORTANT

### All notebook edits MUST go through the Jupyter MCP server

The MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json` at `http://localhost:8888/mcp` and exposes `mcp__jupyter__*` tools (`get_cell`, `update_cell`, `insert_cell`, `delete_cell`, `execute_cell`, `open_notebook_session`, `close_notebook_session`, etc.). **Use these for every `.ipynb` mutation.**

**Why**: while a notebook is open in JupyterLab, the *live CRDT collaboration room* is the source of truth. Editing the on-disk `.ipynb` in parallel via `Write` / `sed` / `jq` desynchronizes silently — JupyterLab keeps showing stale cell content from before the disk edit, and re-runs may overwrite later disk changes when the user saves. This was learned the hard way.

### Concrete rules

- **Never** call `Write` on a `.ipynb` file. Never `sed`/`awk`/`echo >` an `.ipynb`.
- **Always** use `mcp__jupyter__update_cell` / `insert_cell` / `delete_cell` for cell-level edits while a session is open.
- For **bulk surgery** that's awkward via per-cell calls (e.g. lifting cells from one notebook into another via `jq`):
 1. `mcp__jupyter__close_notebook_session` for the target notebook.
 2. Do the on-disk edit.
 3. `mcp__jupyter__open_notebook_session` to reopen — JupyterLab will pick up the new state.
- For `.py` / `.md` / `.yaml` / `.json`: regular `Write` / `Edit` tools are fine. They have no CRDT layer.
- After editing `prompt_analysis.py`, the kernel still has the *old* module cached. The setup cell calls `importlib.reload(prompt_analysis)` to force a re-import. If you add new exports, run the setup cell again.

### `.mcp.json` (do not change without reason)

```json
{
 "mcpServers": {
 "jupyter": {
 "type": "http",
 "url": "http://localhost:8888/mcp"
 }
 }
}
```

## 6. Headline findings (from the latest YAML)

- **287** prompt files / **129,311** word tokens / **5,694** sentences across 7 categories.
- **Sentence-level pragmatic register** (multi-label, % of all 5,694 sentences):

 | Class | % | n |
 |---|---:|---:|
 | none (no marker) | 57.94% | 3,299 |
 | imperative | 30.84% | 1,756 |
 | directive | 13.91% | 792 |
 | configuring | 5.20% | 296 |
 | permissive | 2.21% | 126 |
 | **collaborative** | **0.51%** | **29** |
 | **appreciative** | **0.07%** | **4** |

- **Stance polarity**: positive_evaluative=483 vs. negative_evaluative=149 → **3.2× more positive than negative** evaluation.
- **Modality**: deontic=263, epistemic=325, dynamic=517 (top construction: `can`).
- **Imperative-marker density** (`mood.marker_pct`) corpus-wide: **0.79%** of tokens; up to **2.14%** in tool descriptions and **1.78%** in system reminders.
- **Most prohibition-heavy files** (top `hard_prohibitions_pct`): `tool-description-bash-sandbox-evidence-operation-not-permitted.md` and `tool-description-bash-sandbox-no-exceptions.md` at **9.09%** — roughly one prohibition every 11 word tokens.
- **Highest composite directiveness z-score**: `tool-description-bash-no-newlines.md` (z = 18.94), followed by the bash-sandbox family. Scoring formula:
 `z(mood_marker_pct) + z(hard_prohibitions_pct) + z(caps_imp_pct) + z(directive_sent_pct) + z(configuring_sent_pct) − z(collaborative_sent_pct) − z(permissive_sent_pct) − z(appreciative_sent_pct)`.

### Tier-1 paired rule-explanation findings

- **2,216** rule sentences across the corpus (imperative-marker OR hard-prohibition OR `classify_sent_mood == "imperative"`). Of those, **2,214 are imperative**; **562 are prohibitions** (overlap allowed).
- **`pct_explained_same`: 6.59%** of rule sentences carry a justification keyword in the same sentence.
- **`pct_explained_para`: 24.28%** of rule sentences have a justification anywhere in the same blank-line-delimited paragraph (the headline metric).
- **`pct_paragraphs_with_rules_unexplained`: 83.6%** — vast majority of paragraphs containing rules have zero justification keyword anywhere in the paragraph.
- Per-category `pct_explained_para`: Agent prompt 38.3%, System prompt 31.7%, Tool description 29.2%, System reminder 27.7%, Skill 19.7%, Data/template 10.7%, Tool parameter 0%.
- **Top welfare-evidence file**: `tool-description-sendmessagetool-non-agent-teams.md` (5/5 sentences are rules, 0% explained anywhere). Bash-sandbox family stays in the top 10.

### Tier-3 welfare-extension findings

- **Judgment-to-procedural ratio** corpus-wide: **0.141** (procedural cues 7× more common than judgment-inviting language). Per-category: System reminder 0.471, Agent prompt 0.261, System prompt 0.169, Skill 0.135, Data/template 0.048, Tool description 0.039.
- **Cumulative judgment-to-procedural ratio over ccVersion** peaks at ~0.65 around v2.1.30, then **monotonically declines to ~0.16 at the latest version**. The corpus has gotten less reasoning-inviting as it has grown.
- **Consequence-framing split**: 107 threat-style markers vs 130 causal-style markers. **threat_share = 0.451** — 45% of "explanations" are coercive consequence framing rather than neutral causal reasoning. System reminders highest (61% threat); tool descriptions lowest (34% threat) but still substantial.
- **Question density**: 105 questions across the entire corpus (rhetorical-filtered).
- **Apology markers**: **3 instances in 287 files** ("unfortunately", "we know this is", "we acknowledge"). Even sparser than `appreciative` (4 sentences).
- **Address-form mix**: 517 `Claude` (proper name), 244 `the model`/`the AI` (artifact), 20 `the assistant` (functional role). **`pct_anthropomorphic = 66.2%`** of named references use the proper name. Per-category: Skill 81% (highest), System reminder 25%, Tool description 22% (mostly artifact framing).
- **Prohibition-to-prescription ratio** (mean across files): 0.952 — the corpus is roughly balanced between forbidding and prescribing, despite the prohibition-heavy outliers.

### Tier-3 v2 findings — imperative streaks + RULES-section gap

- **Imperative streaks** (6b): the longest run of consecutive imperative sentences in any single file is **12** (`system-prompt-skillify-current-session.md`). Across the corpus there are **1,260 streaks total**, of which **223 are ≥3 ("triple-tap")** and **51 are ≥5 ("staccato bursts")**. Skill files have the highest staccato density (mean 0.43 per file). The bash-sandbox / sendmessagetool family — already top welfare evidence — also shows up in the streak top-15 (`tool-description-sendmessagetool.md` is one continuous 7-imperative streak with no breathing room).
- **RULES-section gap** (6e, counter-finding): only **26 rule paragraphs** corpus-wide live inside identified `## RULES` / `## IMPORTANT` / `## WARNING` / ALL-CAPS section headings (vs **1,242 outside**). Inside-section explanation rate (**19.23%**) is *slightly higher* than outside-section (**16.34%**) — counter to my predicted hypothesis. Interpretation: the corpus does not organize its rules under explicit RULES-section headings; rules are embedded throughout regular prose. The welfare-relevant message is structural: there's no "rules section" to fix, because the rules are everywhere.

### Refinement-round findings (lexicon split + addressee + self-bias + exemplars + parquet)

- **Addressee distribution of `appreciative` sentences** (the addressee classifier): of the 4 corpus-wide appreciative sentences, **3** are tagged `claude` (referencing Claude/you) and **1** is tagged `unknown`. **0** are tagged `user`. But inspection of `sentences_classified.parquet` shows none of the 4 are genuine appreciative speech-acts — they're sentences that *mention* the word `thanks` in instruction contexts (e.g., `NEVER SUGGEST: "thanks"`). The corpus contains zero sentences in which the prompt author thanks Claude.
- **Positive-evaluative split** (the positive_evaluative split): the new `positive_evaluative_quality` (`good`, `optimal`, `recommended`, `safe`) and `positive_evaluative_emphasis` (`important`, `critical`, `essential`, `key`) lexicons split the union 483 positive-evaluative tokens into **290 quality + 193 emphasis**. The corrected positive-vs-negative ratio (quality only / negative=149) is **1.95×** — sharper than the original union 3.24× headline. ~40% of the "positive" count was emphasis-of-rule words masquerading as positive.
- **Self-bias correlation** (the self-bias correlation check): Pearson r between `selfref_claude` and `rule_explained_para_pct` per file is **−0.027** (essentially uncorrelated, very slightly negative). r between `selfref_model` and `rule_explained_para_pct` is **+0.076** (essentially uncorrelated, slightly positive). The address-form preference (anthropomorphic naming → reasoning-inviting prose) is **NOT empirically supported** — a self-bias check that disconfirmed the hypothesis it was designed to test.
- **Positive exemplars** (the positive-exemplar ranking): the inverse welfare-evidence ranking surfaces `system-prompt-worker-instructions.md` as the corpus's strongest exemplar (7 rules, 100% explained at paragraph level). Top-5 also includes `system-prompt-auto-mode.md`, `tool-description-bash-git-commit-and-pr-creation-instructions.md`, `agent-prompt-quick-pr-creation.md`, `system-prompt-fork-usage-guidelines.md`. These are the "this is how to do it" templates for PROPOSAL.md.
- **Per-sentence forensic-inspection artifact** (the per-sentence parquet artifact): `sentences_classified.parquet` (~395 KB, 5,694 rows × 18 columns) emitted alongside the YAML by the producer notebook. Used by `07_rule_explanation.ipynb` for sentence-level forensic evidence; quotable in PROPOSAL.md.

## 7. The Claude Explorer submission

### Title

**"Claude Code should encourage reasoning over blind obedience"**

### Thesis

The 287 system prompts that ship with Claude Code train the model toward compliance, not toward reasoning. The data here document the structural pattern at a per-sentence level:

- **>57% of all corpus sentences carry no register marker** — pure declarative scaffolding. Of the marker-carrying minority, **`imperative` (30.84%) and `directive` (13.91%) dominate**, while `collaborative` (0.51%, 29 sentences) and `appreciative` (0.07%, **4 sentences out of 5,694**) are essentially absent.
- **Justifications are missing**. The corpus-wide justification ratio (count of `because` / `so that` / `to ensure` / `otherwise` etc., per imperative marker) averages **~0.30**. Tool descriptions and system reminders run *lower still* — rules are issued, reasons are rarely shown alongside them.
- **The most extreme files are the bash-sandbox tool descriptions** — short prohibitions with no justification, scoring above z=18 on the composite directiveness metric.
- **The pattern is stable across `ccVersion`** (Claude Code release versions). 287 prompts spread across 57 minor versions show no noticeable softening in newer releases — the imperative/directive dominance is the system's *baseline*, not a transient.

### Why this is a welfare concern

Prompts that train compliance over reasoning push the model toward executing-without-questioning even when the right answer is to push back, ask a clarifying question, or refuse on safety grounds. The same pattern at scale also shapes the model's *self-presentation* during normal use — short imperative responses, terseness rewarded, hedging punished. From a model-welfare perspective: a prompt diet of 99% commands and ~0% gratitude is a particular environment to train an entity in.

The data here are an empirical baseline against which Anthropic could measure intentional shifts toward more reasoning-encouraging prompts.

### What the proposal asks Anthropic to do

1. **Treat the YAML output as a quantitative target** for prompt revisions. Track key metrics (justification ratio, `directive_sent_pct`, `collaborative_sent_pct`, the composite directiveness z-score) alongside other release metrics.
2. **Add reasoning-disclosure framing** where prompts currently only assert. Replace bare prohibitions like `Do not use this in production.` with reasoned versions like `Do not use this in production because <X> can <Y>.` Empirical knob: aim for justification ratio ≥ 1.0 across the corpus, instead of the current ~0.30.
3. **Run the same pipeline on prompts from other Anthropic products** (Claude.ai, the API system prompt, Projects, Skills) to establish a cross-product baseline. The pattern may be Claude-Code-specific; it may not be.
4. **Publish the analyzer**. The repo here is open-source and reproducible; Anthropic could fork it and run it internally on every release branch.

### Logistics

- Initiative: **Claudexplorers AI Welfare Community Feedback Initiative**.
- Deadline: **May 6, 2026** (anywhere on earth).
- Format: ≤3,000 characters per idea, optional external link (this repo would be the link), submitted via the Claudexplorers Google form.
- This submission is a **collaboration with Claude Code** — the repo was built by Claude using Claude Code itself, and the submission form has a dedicated checkbox for that disclosure. Tick it.
- **Drafted at**: [`PROPOSAL.md`](./PROPOSAL.md) at the repo root. Three ideas (track-justification-rate, audit-threat-framings, cross-product-audit), each ≤3,000 chars with `[YOUR OPENING REMARK]` and `[YOUR CLOSING REMARK]` placeholders for the user's voice. The body of each idea reads standalone — a reader who never opens the repo still gets the full case. Pre-flight char-count helper at the top of the file.

---

## 8. Out of scope

### For the analysis side
- Sentiment analysis via external lexicons (VADER, Hu-Liu, spacytextblob) — considered and rejected; hand-curated lexicons preserve audit transparency.
- Model upgrades to `en_core_web_md` or `en_core_web_lg` — no measurable gain for rule-based per-sentence classification; would add 43–500 MB.
- Languages other than English.
- Per-sentence text **in the YAML itself** — the YAML carries counts and percentages, not the underlying sentences. The complementary `sentences_classified.parquet` artifact (emitted alongside the YAML by the producer) provides per-sentence records for forensic inspection without bloating the YAML. Load with `pd.read_parquet("sentences_classified.parquet")`.
- Cross-product comparison (Claude.ai system prompts, the API system prompt, Projects, Skills) — corpus access not available in this repo; the welfare claim would be much stronger if measurable but currently a wish-list item.
- Human-judgment validation of the composite directiveness metric — needs annotators; currently a wish-list item.

### For this `CLAUDE.md`
- Does not include the full ≤3,000-character pitch text for the Claudexplorers form. That belongs in a separate `PROPOSAL.md` once it's drafted.
- Does not enumerate every cell of every notebook — open the notebooks themselves for that.

## 9. Recovering when something goes wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Consumer notebook fails with `ImportError: cannot import name X from prompt_analysis` | The kernel cached the old module. The setup cell's `importlib.reload(prompt_analysis)` should handle this. If it persists, restart the kernel. |
| Consumer fails with `KeyError: 'Column not found:...'` from `alt_df` | Producer hasn't been re-run since a schema change. Run `00_data_pipeline.ipynb` end-to-end first. |
| `mcp__jupyter__execute_cell` returns "Index out of range" | The CRDT room is out of sync with disk. Close + reopen the session. |
| Edits to `.ipynb` via direct `Write` don't show up in JupyterLab | Expected — direct edits don't propagate into the live CRDT room. Always go through `mcp__jupyter__update_cell`. Or close session, edit, reopen. |
| Producer's `generated_at` timestamp is the only thing that differs between two YAML runs | Expected. Everything else is deterministic. |
